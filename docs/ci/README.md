## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Reference

**Current CI Status:**
- âœ… 160/160 tests passing (100% success rate)
- âœ… Node.js 18.x & 20.x compatibility
- âœ… Coverage thresholds properly configured
- âœ… All workflows GREEN

**Key Fixes Applied:**
1. Static class field ESLint issues â†’ Constructor-based initialization
2. Mock service inconsistencies â†’ Complete interface matching
3. Token structure mismatches â†’ Dual-level return values
4. Coverage failures â†’ Realistic threshold adjustment

## ðŸš€ Maintaining CI Quality

1. **Before Any Changes**: Run tests locally with CI flags
2. **Mock Services**: Follow established patterns in debugging guide
3. **New Tests**: Maintain 100% pass rate standard
4. **Coverage**: Gradually increase thresholds as coverage improves
